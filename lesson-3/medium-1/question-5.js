// Question 5

// What will the following two lines of code output?

console.log(0.3 + 0.6); // 0.9
console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9);
// + has precendence over ===, so it will evaluate 0.9 === 0.9 which evaluates to true

// I was wrong. "Most floating point representations used on computers lack a certain amount of precision"

// 0.8999999999999999
// false
