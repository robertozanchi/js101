1. A function that returns the sum of two numbers

  START

  GET the first number from user
  SET firstNumber = first number received

  GET the second number from user
  SET secondNumber = second number received

  SET total = sum of first and second number
  PRINT total

  END


2. A function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

  # Given an array of strings called "words"

  START
  
  SET iterator = 1
  SET concatenatedString = empty string

  WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
    SET currentstring = value within words collection at space "iterator"
    concatenatedString = concatenatedString + currentstring
    iterator = iterator + 1
  
  PRINT concatenatedString
  
  END


3. A function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

  # Given an array of integers called "allNumbers"

  START

  SET iterator = 1
  SET everyOther = empty array

  GET even or odd position for first element to include in everyOther from user

  WHILE iterator <= length of allNumbers
    SET currentNumber = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
    IF currentNumber matches user's even/odd position preference
      add currentNumber to everyOther array
    ELSE
      skip to the next iteration
  
  PRINT everyOther

  END
